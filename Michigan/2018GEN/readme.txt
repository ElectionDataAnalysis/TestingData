Hints & Tips

(PK) Primary Keys are unique by definition and not absolutely necessary
to obtain what you want from this data. They are only suggestions.

You may choose to ignore/eliminate the Election Year/Type fields
throughout if you find them redundant, however, if you do not eliminate
them, (or at least one of them) upon import of the votes table, the 
suggested Primary Key will not work in products such as Access that 
limit the number of fields in a Primary Key to ten.
 
Two composite indexes are suggested for the votes table, regardless of
whether or not you choose to use Primary Keys:

Key#1: Election Year,
       Election Type,
       Office Code,
       District Code,
       Status Code,
       Candidate ID#
	
Key#2: Election Year,
       Election Type,
       County Code,
       City/Town Code

Eliminate any fields from the above keys if you have chosen not to import them.

Any questions regarding this information can be directed to the Michigan
Bureau of Elections by calling (517) 335-3234.
